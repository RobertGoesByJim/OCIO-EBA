Introduction
============

The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer to produce an Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) for use as a reference point when assessing the alignment between the needs of our citizens, the Province’s strategic business objectives, and our long-term IMIT investments. Specifically, the EBA was asked to deliver:

1.  A record of collective EBA decisions that government has made to support the execution of its strategic directives and service transformation

2.  A unifying business and IMIT framework that strengthens corporate decision making and reduces risk when making investments in digital services

3.  An understanding of the relationship between the government’s strategic intent, the modern service needs of our citizens, and the technology required to enable the path forward

4.  A roadmap for ministries and related government bodies to use when planning future initiatives from both business and technical perspectives

5.  A proposed future state for government services based on identified business needs and required technical capabilities

The *Enterprise Business Architecture for the Government of British Columbia* is the response to this request. It is designed to be a government “blueprint” outlining an agreed upon set of business and technology principles that helps a) shape the design and creation of modern government services, b) set corporate direction and funding priorities for IMIT investments, and c) enable government to implement business and technology solutions that truly meet the needs and expectations of our citizens. The cornerstone of this document is what we are calling the *EBA Framework,* which is the visual representation of the tenets we believe reflect the future-state business and technology needs required to transform government service delivery.

The EBA has not taken a traditional approach to defining the government’s business architecture. This is because we looked at what was already available in the EBA space and found most documents to be either a) academic in nature and not consumable by government service owners-our target audience, or b) technology architectures disguised as business architectures which again would provide little value to our stakeholders. Instead, it was decided to take a “fusion” approach to EBA whereby we would combine many of the traditional building blocks from the enterprise architecture discipline (TOGAF[1]) with the strategic intent of the BC Government and infuse them both with the future state service needs of our citizens. The end result being a document that speaks to the needs of service owners within the BC Government by giving them a guide for architecting the modern services British Columbian’s expect.

Finally, it is critical that *The Enterprise Business Architecture for the Government of British Columbia* exists as living document as it must be updated on a regular basis to reflect the rapidly evolving business and technology needs of government services. Included below is the bi-annual refresh schedule complete with quarterly milestones that ASPB will work to in an effort to keep the document current and relevant to those who will look to it for guidance.

EBA Principles
==============

In creating this document, the Architecture, Standards, and Planning Branch (ASPB) adopted a set of principles to guide how the document was structured and to determine the themes that influence the content at each layer. The principles used to build the EBA are:

1.  The EBA framework is about alignment and enablement. It is designed to produce a record of key business and technology decisions that government has made in order to create a cohesive corporate direction and to support the activities of service transformation

2.  The EBA must be valuable to our stakeholders - this means that it becomes an important business tool that produces better investment decision making and more impactful services

3.  “Just Enough Architecture” is always the right amount. The EBA is modular by design, allowing stakeholders to pick and choose the components that are the best fit for their initiative

4.  The documents are transitional and future looking. Their primary purpose is to create a picture of the proposed future state and highlight specific actions and technologies required to get there

5.  The tone and content of the EBA is deliberately thought provoking and aspirational. The expectation is that the document will act as a catalyst for more in depth conversations leading to new and innovative ways of delivering services

6.  It is a living document and will be reviewed quarterly and updated bi-annually. The pace of change in business and technology innovation means we must regularly review the EBA for relevancy

EBA Outcomes
============

These outcomes are designed to provide a clear articulation of how the EBA will help service owners create and deliver services more effectively. While the tangible outcomes of leveraging the EBA (e.g. money saved, less time to implement, decreased risk, and reduced duplication) will be realized at the initiative level, including EBA specific outcomes creates a reference point to evaluate the long-term value of the document. The outcomes expected from the EBA are:

1.  *Increased awareness of the government’s strategic intent through the creation of a sanctioned record of business and technology principles*
: The EBA content will lead to an endorsed set of key business and technology decisions that service owners can use when making transformation decisions. It should provide insight into the types of services and technology that leaders in government have endorsed and will look to when assessing ministry initiatives                    
2.  *Improved consciousness of the interdependencies between the needs of citizens, the strategies of government, and the capabilities of technology* 
:	The EBA will show a clear relationship between the needs, expectations, and products required to support the transformation of government services. The document’s three perspectives are not silos, but instead, collaborative and equally critical participants in shaping government’s “digital ecosystem”
3.  *Stronger alignment between government initiatives and desired outcomes*                                                                          : The document will allow service owners to assess the alignment of their initiatives on two levels: a) to the stated business and technology objectives of government, and b) to the needs and expectations of citizens and the services they receive                                                                                            
4.  *Reduced uncertainty and risk to the overall decision making process across government*                                                           :	The EBA will reduce risk for service owners by giving them an endorsed government direction to follow when designing and building their solutions. Uncertainty is removed by having many of the enterprise level decisions and programs in place and readily consumable by their programs                                                     
5.  *A Higher return on investment from the technology we employ as part of service transformation*                                                   : The document will provide a clear direction on the types of technology enablers service owners should be investing in in to get the best return on our transformation investments. Service owners should reference the EBA when evaluating technology so that the choices made are in-line with government’s technology future-state roadmaps
6.  *Improved understanding of the impact of disruptive technology on the future of government services*                                              : The document will demonstrate the impact of disruptive technologies such as mobility, cloud, and open data on service delivery. Service owners should come away with a greater understanding of the influence of disruptive technologies on their current and future decisions                                                                |

EBA and the New Solution Domains
================================

The first thing to understand about the EBA is that it does not exist in a vacuum; rather, it is one component in a larger ecosystem contributing to a shift in the way government builds services. A set of new solution domains have been identified that will move government forward more rapidly and efficiently on its transformation journey. Work is underway across all domains in an effort to introduce a whole of government approach to solutioning whereby service owners leverage a series of corporate playbooks to tackle their immediate business issues. These playbooks will provide a set of repeatable building actions that reduce the effort, time, and money required to build or enhance services. The EBA is one of these playbooks. The following diagram outlines the new domains for business solution design:

![alt text](../images/circles.png "Solutions Domain")


| **Domain**                            | **Impact on Service Transformation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

Service Design                        
Service design is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between service provider and in our case citizens[2]. Government has made a concerted effort to incorporate service design principles, especially those related to citizen engagement, into our initiatives. *The Service Design Playbook* is the blueprint for this domain. The impact of service design on transformation is the creation of services truly for citizens by citizens as opposed to those government think they want and most often deliver
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Enterprise Business Architecture     
EBA is a description of the structure and interaction between the business strategy, organization, functions, business processes, and information needs. The impact of EBA on service transformation is the creation of a corporately agreed upon set of business and technology building blocks that are readily available to service owners across government. These building blocks will bring clarity to the needs of citizens, strategic intent of government, and technology enablers required to deliver high quality government services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Collaborative Application Development     
Collaborative Application development changes the way government has traditionally done application development in two ways. First, it puts the needs of the citizen front and centre by including them throughout the creation process giving them multiple opportunities to provide feedback on the product to be delivered. Second, it looks to collaboration amongst developers in the form of self-organizing teams to plan, debate, and produce solutions. The BC Developers’ Exchange is government’s first attempt at building out this capacity. The impact of collaborative application design on service transformation will be a far better product both in terms of meeting the needs of citizens and bringing a more agile approach to application development                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Enterprise Integration     
Enterprise integration focusses on the way government finds creative and innovative ways to leverage the shift to cloud computing. For this shift to be successful, we must make a concerted effort to leverage a cloud-based enterprise integration platform. The platform must link the people, process, data, and technology horizontally in line with citizen need irrespective of traditional ministry boundaries. The work underway at CloudBC[3] will be instrumental in laying the foundation for enterprise integration in the province. The impact of enterprise integration means government can create services that are bundled and personalized as citizen information will travel with them so they have it when they need it. It also will mean new choices for interacting with government, specifically in the mobility space, will become technically feasible and available                                                                                                    

Common Services     
The evolution of common services centres on the creation of enterprise level programs, policies, processes, and technologies that enable a consistent experience across services. An example would be a common pay platform whereby citizens would experience the same level of service whether buying a government licence, paying their taxes, or purchasing government services. The job of the service owner would also be made easier as they would have access to ready-made services that they could incorporate into their business solutions reducing effort, time and money. The impact of common services on service transformation will be twofold. First, government will be better able to respond on the modern service needs of citizens through the availability of standardized enterprise services. Second, they will reduce the risk to government as common services bring repeatability, consistency, and reduced cost to the delivery of the specific services they provide

LEAN     
The tools and practices associated with the government’s adoption of LEAN[4] is a critical enabler across all the aforementioned business solution domains. As government modernizes and transforms its services, it must not simply move existing processes to the digital ecosystem. Rather, as part of an overall redesign effort, a LEAN exercise should be applied holistically across services to reduce waste, red tape, and streamline execution so that every step that the citizen and employee undertake provides value. The impact of LEAN on service transformation will be the creation of services that truly align with the needs of citizens while empowering employees to be more efficient and get more done with less                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

AGILE     
Government must also change the way it develops applications as the traditional approach to system design has proven to be unwieldy and unresponsive. Agile, and its philosophies around continuous iterative delivery, self-forming teams, and high levels of collaboration, is the second critical enabler to the new business solution domains. Instead of the waterfall approach, whereby solutions are delivered in a linear fashion with little visibility into the product until the time of delivery, Agile promotes development in a continuous manner relying on significant customer feedback throughout and delivering a series of small incremental products. The impact of Agile on service transformation will be the increased speed and accuracy at which government can respond to the service needs of our citizens                                                                                                                                                             |

The EBA Context
===============

The second step to understanding the EBA is clearly defining the EBA context. To do this, the following section describes how the document was created, the business enablers that can benefit from aligning with the EBA principles, and the technology enablers required to support execution.

![alt text](../images/EBA_IO_BigPicture.png "EBA Big Picture")

**Inputs: Strategic Intent and Business Priorities**     
 

At the top of the diagram are the EBA inputs which are derived from the government’s strategic intent, business priorities and key organizations shaping the direction of digital transformation. This includes a) ministry business, strategic, and service plans, b) government strategies like Citizens @ the Centre, and c) directives and guidance from senior government bodies like the Deputy Minister’s Council on Transformation and Technology (DMCTT). A review of these documents was completed which uncovered a set of critical business and technology enablers that government will need to acquire over the next three to five years if transformation is to be successful. The following outlines specifically how the EBA inputs were used to create the various sections within the framework:

-   The inputs were first used to populate the top two sections of the EBA framework. These sections set the strategic context for transformation decisions (light blue) and establish a common business environment for government (green)

-   The inputs were then meshed with the OCIO Strategy and the standard enterprise architecture domains[5] to establish a set of IMIT enablers that support the strategic and business environments (dark blue)

-   The final use the for the inputs is to identify common business and technology themes that could either leverage an existing service or be used to justify the creation of new ones (orange)

With the EBA Framework in place, the next step is to identify a) a set technology enablers that would help the builders of government solutions align with the EBA, and b) key business processes and activities that would benefit from using the EBA as an input when making decisions about service design.

**Output: Technology Enablers**   
![alt text](../images/ICON_CircleMap.png "")IMIT Roadmaps   
IMIT roadmaps are plans that match the government’s strategic and operational goals with a release schedule of technology solutions and services. Roadmaps are valuable because a) it helps reach a consensus about the technologies required to meet business objectives, b) it provides a mechanism to help forecast technology developments, and c) it provides a framework to help plan and prioritize technology investments

![alt text](../images/ICON_ReferenceArchitectures.png "")Reference Architectures   
Reference architectures provide a comprehensive solution template for a technology within a specific domain such as cloud computing. The value of reference architectures is their ability to aggregate, in a single model, the many concerns required to implement a solution which includes business architecture, data architecture, technology architecture, security, policy and legislation, and governance. Our reference architectures will focus on the five pillars in the OCIO strategic plan

![alt text](../images/ICON_TechnologyBlueprints.png "")Technology Blueprints   
Technology blueprints are a lower level abstraction of reference architectures as they go into the specifics of the technology that the government will be implementing based on the schedule from the roadmaps. The value of blueprints is their ability to provide a clear list of technologies that our partners can expect to be available when planning out their initiatives

![alt text](../images/ICON_IMITStandards.png "")Enterprise IMIT Standards  
IMIT Standards bring consistency, interoperability, and economies of scale to the enablement of digital services. The value of having standards is that they provide a common language and an agreed upon set of IMIT decisions designed to ensure compatibility between systems, devices, and vendors. In the government context, they also support compliance with government policies and legislation such as privacy and the protection of personal information

**Guidance: Business Enablers**

![alt text](../images/ICON_DesignPatterns.png "")Common Services and Design Patterns  
In an effort to bring consistency to the citizen experience and reduce costs for government, the EBA advocates for the use and/or creation of common services. Common services are enterprise focused and produce a standardized set of capabilities that can be leveraged across government regardless of the line of business it supports. An example of a common service is payment-either to or by government. Within each common service there is a set of standard design patterns which are building blocks that aggregate to create a service. Service design patterns bring value by establishing a consistent way that a repeated activity, like paying government, is designed, built and executed

![alt text](../images/ICON_CapitalPlanning.png "")IMIT Capital Planning  
The EBA should provide a both a reference point and measuring stick for IMIT Capital submissions.  First, plans should have strong alignment with the strategic and business context of government as outlined in the EBA. This helps answer the “why” government should undertake an initiative. Second, the submission should measure its proposed solution against the stated IMIT direction found in the EBA. This helps answer “how” the innovative will leverage technology to create a solution. A successful IMIT Capital submission should have strong alignment to both the business and technology principles in the EBA

Ministry Projects  
The EBA should perform the same function for Ministry projects as it does for the IMIT Capital Planning process. There should be strong, measurable alignment between the project and the business and technology enablers outlined in the EBA


##  The EBA Framework Overview ##

The *EBA Framework* is a visual representation of the request made by DMCTT for an enterprise business architecture. Taking a top-down, modular approach, the framework presents the high-level relationship between government strategy, service delivery context, and technology enablement. The top two layers (light blue and green) are all about strategy and business intent as they define the business components of the ecosystem. Their focus is to give clarity to what we do and what citizens expect us to deliver. The bottom two layers (dark blue and orange) focus on future state technology and ideas for cross-government enablers via common services.

Layer 1: Aligning to Our Business Context (light blue)
------------------------------------------------------

The top layer establishes the strategic drivers that influence and inform the rest of the EBA. First, we include the three overarching strategies that most affect our stakeholder groups. It is the goals of these three documents that collectively define the government’s business landscape and become our beacon for business alignment by the other architecture domains. From these strategies come the sector responses in the form of actions and initiatives that ministries believe will support the goals and outcomes of government. The artifacts used to establish the context for this layer include IMIT Capital Planning submissions, Service Plans, and the many line of business action plans.

Layer 2: Defining the Business Environment (green)
--------------------------------------------------

This layer translates the strategic intent of government into a set of future state service needs. First, based on an aggregation of government strategies, the document establishes a set of service themes that have been identified as critical path initiatives for the next 5 years. It is important to note that this list is based on themes and not individual projects. The reason for this is that, from the analysis of the strategy documents, it became apparent that many sectors have similar underlying business needs that can best be resolved by tackling the issues from an enterprise perspective.

The second layer introduces the service design patterns we believe best describe the building blocks behind many government services. To be clear, not all services require all service design patterns; rather, their value comes from their ability for service owners to identify modular and repeatable components that aggregate into the service they need to deliver. This approach creates better outcomes for citizens by producing a consistent experience across program areas. For example, when a citizen needs to pay government for a service, they are not met with different processes and tasks each time. Leveraging service patterns also provides value to government by presenting a standardized set of capabilities that reduces the resources required to implement their initiative. Going back to the pay government example, rather than re-invent the wheel and design their own payment process, service owners can look to the service pattern and know that using it will expedite the delivery of their initiative and produce a more efficient and consistent service experience.

The final layer of this section is where the *EBA Framework* starts to delve into the traditional architecture domains by laying out a set of business architecture principles that underpin the government’s overall business architecture. These tenets reflect an agreed upon set of common service architectures that should be considered when modifying or designing new government services. It is also the intersection point between business intent and technology enablement as we begin to organizing the stated business principles around the OCIO’s 5 pillars. For example, the first principle of this layer discusses the need for blended choice across delivery channels. It is aligned with the mobility pillar because we want to stress the importance of, at a minimum, considering the applicability of a mobile channel as part of a service.

Layer 3: Establishing Our New Architectural Foundation (dark blue)
------------------------------------------------------------------

This layer is where we fuse the traditional domains from enterprise architecture (TOGAF) and the technology enablers (5 pillars) with the future state service needs of our citizens. A matrix is used where the intersection of an EA domain and a pillar informs the service owner of how a technology can empower them to meet their service transformation goals. For example, the intersection between the digital pillar and application architecture focuses on channel integration. In other words, as a service moves to the digital world, application design must consider how it interacts across all channels including in person, call-centre, mobile, and digital and be sure that they produce consistent results regardless of choice by the citizen.

Important to note is that while this layer is framed by technology enablers, its principles remain focussed on service design and delivery. While the technology is important, it is critical that the *EBA Framework* demonstrate to service owners’ how using a particular technology will help them meet their service goals and objectives. An example would be the intersection between the cloud pillar and data architecture. While cloud technology and data integration are important to understand when designing a service, the rational for leveraging this technology is all about the portability of citizen data when and where they need it and so they don’t have to keep entering their information for each transaction.

Layer 4: Collaborating for Better Results (orange) 
---------------------------------------------------

The final layer of the *EBA Framework* is included to identify the common services that are available to service owners. Common services are cross-government business enablers that provide value to both the citizen and government. For the citizen, using common services means they will come to know what to expect when interacting with government regardless of the service they need. For government, using a common service will reduce the effort required to plan, build, and run a service. A prime example is Pay BC as it brings a standardized payment platform available to all government services.

Using the EBA for Business Results
==================================

This section explains *when* the EBA should be used and *how* to leverage the content to make better business decisions and design services. For the *when*, the EBA references the initiative lifecycle which is a high-level series of steps that constitute the service design process. The EBA framework contributes throughout the lifecycle as service owners can regularly check back with the document to see if their initiative remains in-step with government direction. For the *how*, the EBA walks through the *EBA* alignment process whereby an initiative measures its alignment against the tenets at each layer of the EBA to come up with an alignment “score”[6]. The higher the score, the stronger the alignment which, in turn, will work to identify investments that are in the best interests of both government and citizens.

EBA and the Initiative Lifecycle
--------------------------------

The initiative lifecycle is a basic framework that highlights the steps a new service will take starting from the initial concept or need and finishing when the service “hits the market” and is available for use.

![alt text](../images/InitiationLoop.PNG "Initiative Lifecycle")

To answer the question “when to use the EBA?” the case can be made to use it throughout the lifecycle. At all points along the journey, it will help answer questions like:

-   Is this a service that citizens want?

-   Should government invest in this service?

-   Does it align with government’s goals and objectives?

-   Are we building this right?

-   Do we have the resources to execute?

-   Does this service have value across government?

The following lists the ways in which the framework provides guidance and validation at each phase:

| **Phase**             | **EBA Guidance**                                                            |

# The EBA Alignment Process #

The other big question around the value of the EBA can be demonstrated by what we are calling the EBA Alignment Process*.* This process is designed to take an initiative/project and “score” it vis-à-vis its alignment to the various domains of the EBA. For the purpose of this example, scoring takes the form of lighting up boxes on the framework itself. The more boxes that are lit up the greater the alignment. In the future, there will be an EBA alignment checklist that stakeholders can use to assess their initiative/project aligns with corporate direction.


![alt text](../images/EBA_AlignmentProcess.PNG "EBA Alignment Process")

| **Step** | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Business Inputs and Outcomes

Alignment at this step is all about identifying the business context and service outcomes of a particular initiative. Using documents like service plans, IMIT Capital submissions, and project plans we begin to collect intelligence on the rational for a proposed solution and the value it will deliver. With respect to the business context, it is critical to understand the types of services an organization delivers, how they do so today, and what is their future direction. In terms of outcomes, we use this step to uncover what the initiative hopes to achieve, the capabilities it will need to execute, and if the proposed solution will in fact produce the stated outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

Strategic Alignment

The layer is used to gauge alignment with government’s key strategy documents (BC Technology Strategy, Citizen @ the Centre, Being the Best 2.0) and their related principles or goals. For example, if the initiative’s solution is citizen facing, we would reference Citizen @ the Centre and assess if it aligns with “saving citizens’ time in their interaction with government and making it easier to access better quality services?” If it does, the initiative would receive alignment points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Business Alignment

This step is used to evaluate alignment with the government’s current business environment. Alignment is measured at three levels. First, there is an assessment of the alignment with the future state service needs of government. This is a list of service “themes” gleaned out the various plans from across government that show the types of services that are going to be developed. Alignment here is to see if the proposal matches up with the types of services deemed important to government. Second, there is an evaluation vis-à-vis the government’s service patterns. Service patterns are the business building blocks that describe what government does. Alignment here will demonstrate that the initiative is in concert with the types of activities citizens expect government to deliver. Finally, alignment is gauged against the framework’s business architecture principles. This layer describes foundational tenets that guide the way government wants to transform its services. Alignment here is to measure the level at which the initiative has embraced these principles as reflected by the proposed solution 

Pillars

At this point, the EBA starts measure the alignment of an initiative against technology enablers. This layer specifically measures the alignment with the 5 pillars outlined in the OCIO Strategy. The purpose of the pillars is to establish a set of high-level set directives for the future looking technologies expected to influence the way government designs and delivers services. Alignment for this layer will be measured against the inclusion of the 5 pillars as part of the solution. By no means must a service leverage the 5 pillars; however, given that this is the stated direction of the OCIO, there may be a need to rationalize their exclusion from the solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

Architecture Alignment

Alignment at this layer is measured against the 4 remaining architecture domains-data, application, technology, and security. Data-is it open, integrated across services, and available for service measurement and analytics. Application-does the solution design follow user experience principles, integrate across service channels, and incorporate mobile devices. Technology-does the technology selected give citizens and employees choice, reflect the technology they use in their everyday life, and enable service delivery even in remote locations. Security-is the citizen or employee confident that their information and digital identify is safe even in the cloud, are data security and privacy mechanisms explicitly identified in the solution, and are the concerns of citizens and employees reflected in the security design of the service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Common Services

The alignment exercise at this layer is to evaluate an initiative’s potential use of corporate common services. Leveraging common services is seen as crucial to building a consistent citizen service experience across programs and driving down the cost of service delivery for government. For example, if a new service either collects money on behalf of government or pays money to citizens, there needs to be an assessment on the feasibility of using PayBC as its payment broker. Again, an initiative is not mandated to use the bundle of common services but it will be required to make a strong case as to why it does not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Recommendations

The final step in the process is to provide the initiative with an assessment of its alignment with the EBA and recommendations for next steps. First, it gives an overall assessment of the alignment which highlights areas where it is strong and areas where there are gaps and opportunities for improvement. Next, the recommendations focus in on the specific principles that the initiative “lit up” during the course of the alignment exercise and provides further direction on how to incorporate them into the initiative and the value of doing so. Finally, it provides the initiative with a list of specific gaps where it is either a) in contradiction to the stated corporate direction in the EBA which would warrant more discussion with the service owner, or b) apparent that the solution is close to being in alignment with the EBA principles and with some assistance from ASPB can strengthen it alignment score                                                                                                                                                                                                      

The EBA Refresh Cycle
=====================

As stated earlier, the EBA must be a living document that reflects the rapid pace of change and innovation faced by government. This section outlines the bi-annual refresh cycle for the EBA and the groups responsible for endorsement throughout the process. The decision was made to refresh the document twice a year in order to a) capture the release of new strategies and executive directives that impact the content of the EBA, b) summarize the current business and technology needs of service owners as revealed in business plans and IMIT Capital submissions, and c) assess the impact of new technologies and common services on the way government will design and deliver services.

![alt text](../images/Refresh_QTimeline.PNG "EBA Refresh Cycle")

The refresh cycle will consist of two six-month cycles that more or less mirror each other. They will start with a review and research phase where the ASPB team will spend time meeting with stakeholders to collect feedback and reviewing the latest direction of government. With the first draft of the new changes, the ASPB team will take the EBA to the Service Strategic Working Group for a second round of feedback and possibly more edits-this process will be iterative as there may be several engagements along the way. The goal is to gain endorsement from the working group to bring the updated EBA to the Service Delivery Board. The next step then is to have the Service Delivery Board review the EBA. Again, this process will be iterative with time given for several meetings to take place prior to the board’s endorsement and release of the new version. The lists of tasks associated with the lifecycle are as follows:

| **Phase**                                      | **Tasks**                                                                                   |
